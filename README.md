## Description

This branch contains code examples and implementations related to Algorithm Analysis and Lists. It covers topics such as time complexity analysis, linked lists, and other list-based data structures.

## Topics Covered

- Algorithm Analysis
- Linked Lists
- Other List-Based Data Structures

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this branch, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone -b new-branch https://github.com/your-username/CS_010B.git
```
## Usage

The code in this branch is organized into directories for each topic, including Algorithm Analysis and Lists. Inside each directory, you will find code examples and possibly exercises related to that topic. The code is well-commented and should be easy to follow.

To run the code, use a [compiler/interpreter] for [language]. For example, to compile a C++ program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
```

Replace program_name with the name of the program you want to compile.

## Contributing
