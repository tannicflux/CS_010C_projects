## Description

This branch contains revised code for the CS_010B course, focusing on Object Oriented Progaramming. The revisions address issues found in the original code, improve code readability, and optimize algorithms where applicable.

## Changes

The changes in this branch include but are not limited to:

- Refactored code for improved readability
- Corrected errors and bugs
- Optimized algorithms for better performance
- Updated documentation and comments

## Getting Started

To get started with the revised code, clone this branch to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone -b revision https://github.com/your-username/CS_010B.git
```

## Usage

The revised code is organized by topics covered in the CS_010B course. The code contains a code which uses all topics covered in CS_010B. The code is well-commented and should be easy to follow.

To run the revised code, use a compiler for C++. For example, to compile a C++ program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
```
